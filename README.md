# Random Joke Generator 

A Random Joke Generator project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a fun and interactive way to explore web development concepts. 
This project fetches a random joke and displays it on the screen each time a button is clicked. 
It's simple to build yet demonstrates the integration of front-end web technologies and APIs.
